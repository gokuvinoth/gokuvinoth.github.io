 Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus
Christ,[8][9] observed primarily on December 25[4][10][11] as a
religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around
the world.[2][12][13] A feast central to the Christian liturgical
year, it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast
and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in
the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night;[14] in
some traditions, Christmastide includes an octave.[15] Christmas
Day is a public holiday in many of the world's
nations,[16][17][18] is celebrated religiously by a majority of
Christians,[19] as well as culturally by many
non-Christians,[1][20] and forms an integral part of the holiday
season centered around it
